# Blockchain-Based-E-Voting-System

Electronic voting (e-voting) systems are an essential tool for modern democracies, offering speed, convenience, and accessibility. However, traditional e-voting systems face challenges related to security, transparency, and trust. To address these challenges, this project proposes a blockchain-based e-voting system that leverages the inherent features of blockchain technology: decentralization, immutability, and transparency. The system ensures the integrity and confidentiality of votes by implementing secure cryptographic algorithms for voter authentication and data encryption. Each vote is recorded as a transaction on a blockchain, creating a tamper-proof, auditable ledger. The decentralized nature of blockchain eliminates the need for a central authority, reducing risks of fraud and manipulation.
